Corba (C++ and Java)
=====

The server and the client are implemented in C++ and Java respectively. 

Installation
-------------

Please consult the documents located at doc/ 

### Makefile

All you have to change is the "OMNI_HOME" variable. It is the --prefix argument you have specified
at the calling the `configure` script.

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local # /usr/local is the default value
### Optional TODO
Write server and client for both languages, which won't be too hard.
